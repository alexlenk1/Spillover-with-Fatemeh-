For this sub-analysis, the anaytical sample is the sample of:
CONTROL KIDS
Here, we DO include the pre-assessment scores and we include "number of treated neighbors" as explanatory variable controlling for total number of neighbors.

Here is a brief description of the tables:

create_main_table7: main regression table with child fixed effects

create_table34: table 3 contains the average cog and non cog scores at each assessment period, table 4 contains summary statistics on observables such as education or age

create_table56: table 5 contains the average number of treated and control neighbors at each assessment, table 6 contains the proprtion of treated neighbors at each assessment

table10spillover_girlgirl: contains anaysis of the spillover effect of female neighbors on female origin kids

table11a: contains analysis of spillover effect of neighbors of own race vs. neighbors of different race from one's own

table11spillover_race: contains analysis of spillover effect within the subsample of Blacks and within the subsample of Hispanics

table12spillover_hisphisp: contains anaysis of the spillover effect of Hispanic neighbors on Hispanic origin kids

table13spillover_blackblack: contains anaysis of the spillover effect of Black neighbors on Black origin kids

table1415: table 14 contains summary statistics on number of control and treated neighbors by rings, table 15 contains the fadeout regressions

table16_mechanism: compares spillover effect of prek-k treated nieghbors vs. parent academy treated neighbors

table1718_friend_network: contains analysis of the friends network

table8spillover_gender: contains analysis of spillover effect within the subsample of males and within the subsample of females

table9spillover_boyboy: contains anaysis of the spillover effect of male neighbors on male origin kids

tables_appendix: contains the analysis of spillover effect by separate sub-scores rather than aggregated cog and non-cog

tables_newversion: uses an alternative definition of noncog = average of ospan, spatial, psra if all subscores available; if at least one missing, ncog is undefined
