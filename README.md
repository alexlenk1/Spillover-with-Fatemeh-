run_project.do builds the necessary data sets and conducts the analysis. It is the one stop button for everything.
Before running the "run_project" do file, make sure you change to the directory to which you cloned the repository on your local computer. 

The "data" folder is empty. When cloning the repository to the local computer, the user should include the raw data files in the "pre_made" subfolder of the "data" folder.

"Variable_dictionary" contains explanations for the treatment assignment variables used in the analysis.
