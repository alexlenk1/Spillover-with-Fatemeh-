These variables are defined in "relevant_unique_data_clean" and "creating_panel" dofiles:
Multiple Treatment Assignment Variables
C - assigned to control once
CC - assigned to control twice
CT - assigned to control and then to treatment other than kinderprep
CK- assigned to control and then to kinderprep
T - assigned to treatment once other than kinderprep
TT - assigned to treatment twice (both treatments different from kinderprep)
TTT - assigned to treatment three times (all treatments different from kinderprep)
TK - assigned to treatment different from kinderprep and then assigned to kinderprep
K - assigned to kinderprep once

CT_pretreat = 1 if CT == 1 AND observation occurs before a subject receives treatment (different from kinderprep)
CK_pretreat = 1 if CK == 1 AND observation occurs before a subject receives kinderprep

first_random - first year of randomisation type of treatment observation
second_random - second year of randomisation type of treatment observation
third_random - third year of randomisation type of treatment observation

kinder_elig - equals to 1 if at a particular assessment, kid is eligible to be in kindergarten (i.e., if by August, 17 of the academic year the assessment takes place, the kid was older than 5)
school_elig - equals to 1 if at a particular assessment, kid is eligible to be in first grade (i.e., if by September, 1 of the academic year the assessment takes place, the kid was older than 6)	

These variables are defined in "multiple_year_neighbor_countby_distance" dofile:
v1cog_contr - average cognitive score of all control neighbors for whom we have a score (version1)
v2cog_contr - average cognitive score of all control neighbors for whom we have a score (version2)
v1ncog_contr - average non-cognitive score of all control neighbors for whom we have a score (version1)
v2ncog_contr - average non-cognitive score of all control neighbors for whom we have a score (version2)
  
v1cog_treat - average cognitive score of all treated neighbors for whom we have a score (version1)
v2cog_treat - average cognitive score of all treated neighbors for whom we have a score (version2)
v1ncog_treat - average non-cognitive score of all treated neighbors for whom we have a score (version1)
v2ncog_treat - average non-cognitive score of all treated neighbors for whom we have a score (version2)

v1cog_nktreat - average cognitive score of all treated neighbors (except for kinderprep) for whom we have a score (version1)
v2cog_nktreat - average cognitive score of all treated neighbors (except for kinderprep) for whom we have a score (version2)
v1ncog_nktreat - average non-cognitive score of all treated neighbors (except for kinderprep) for whom we have a score (version1)
v2ncog_nktreat - average non-cognitive score of all treated neighbors (except for kinderprep) for whom we have a score (version2)

month_incontr_contr - average number of months control neighbors have spent in control      
month_incontr_treat - average number of months treated neighbors have spent in control
month_incontr_nktreat - average number of months treated neighbors (without kinderprep) have spent in control

month_intreat_treat - average number of months treated neighbors have spent in treatment
month_intreat_nktreat - average number of months treated neighbors (without kinderprep) have spent in treatment
month_intreat_contr - average number of months control neighbors have spent in treatment (SHOULD ALWAYS BE EQUAL TO 0)

num_in_treat - number of times a neighbor has been randomised in treatment 

We define the average performance variables and length since randomized in treatment/control also by type of treatment. So for instance,
v1cog_cash - average cogntive score of all neighbors randomized in cash for whom we have a score (version1)
month_incontr_college - average number of months college neighbors have spent in control

These variables are defined in neighbors_gender_race_merged:

We also define the number of neighbors variables, average performance variables and length since being randomized in treatment/control
at race and gender level. For instance,

v1cog_pka_500_m - average cognitive score for MALE neighbors randomised in pka, living within 500 m radius of the origin kid
v1cog_pka_500_f - average cognitive score for FEMALE neighbors randomised in pka, living within 500 m radius of the origin kid
v1cog_pka_500_b - average cognitive score for BLACK neighbors randomised in pka, living within 500 m radius of the origin kid
v1cog_pka_500_h - average cognitive score for HISPANIC neighbors randomised in pka, living within 500 m radius of the origin kid
v1cog_pka_500_o - average cognitive score for OTHER RACE neighbors randomised in pka, living within 500 m radius of the origin kid
v1cog_pka_500_n - average cognitive score for MISSING RACE neighbors randomised in pka, living within 500 m radius of the origin kid
v1cog_pka_500_w - average cognitive score for MISSING RACE neighbors randomised in pka, living within 500 m radius of the origin kid


These variables are defined in teacherease subfolder:
n_"type of treatment""trimester"_"class" - number of neighbors (classmates) of given treatment type in a given trimester for a given class
example: n_collegeT1_LA - number of neighbors randomised in college in trimester 1 of class Language and Arts
