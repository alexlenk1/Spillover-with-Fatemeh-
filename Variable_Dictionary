Multiple Treatment Assignment Variables

C - assigned to control once
CC - assigned to control twice
CT - assigned to control and then to treatment other than kinderprep
CK- assigned to control and then to kinderprep
T - assigned to treatment once other than kinderprep
TT - assigned to treatment twice (both treatments different from kinderprep)
TTT - assigned to treatment three times (all treatments different from kinderprep)
TK - assigned to treatment different from kinderprep and then assigned to kinderprep
K - assigned to kinderprep once

CT_pretreat = 1 if CT == 1 AND observation occurs before a subject receives treatment (different from kinderprep)
CK_pretreat = 1 if CK == 1 AND observation occurs before a subject receives kinderprep

first_random - first year of randomisation type of treatment observation
second_random - second year of randomisation type of treatment observation
third_random - third year of randomisation type of treatment observation

month_incontr_contr - average number of months control neighbors have spent in control      
month_incontr_treat - average number of months treated neighbors have spent in control
month_incontr_nktreat - average number of months treated neighbors (without kinderprep) have spent in control

month_intreat_nktreat - average number of months treated neighbors (without kinderprep) have spent in treatment
month_intreat_contr - average number of months control neighbors have spent in treatment (SHOULD ALWAYS BE EQUAL TO 0)

kinder_elig - equals to 1 if at a particular assessment, kid is eligible to be in kindergarten (i.e., if by August, 17 of the academic year the assessment takes place, the kid was older than 5)
school_elig - equals to 1 if at a particular assessment, kid is eligible to be in kindergarten (i.e., if by September, 1 of the academic year the assessment takes place, the kid was older than 6)
